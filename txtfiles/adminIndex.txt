I am currently a second semester Computer Science student at Concordia University looking to be hired as a Web Designer. I am seeking an internship at a reputable company where I can expand my knowledge of HTML, CSS and other technologies. My goal is to work with like-minded people to create something significant, whilst developing my problem-solving and creative skills.|My name is Alexanne Marcil and I am currently a Computer Science major at Concordia. My passion for web development and programming comes from the problem-solving and logical aspects of the field, as well as my interest in technology. I am constantly looking for opportunities to get familiar with and learn new technologies, which is why I have recently become a member of the Formula Racing team at SAE Concordia. I also wanted to be part of a team, as I believe it is the most efficient and enriching way to learn and create. During my time at university, I have been able to maintain 4.0 GPA. I had also been granted two awards before entering university. My courses have allowed me to gain experience with HTML and CSS, as well as Java.
