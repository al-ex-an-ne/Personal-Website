I am currently a second semester Computer Science student at Concordia University. My current goal is to work as an intern with like-minded people to create something significant, whilst developing my problem-solving and creative skills.|My name is Alexanne Marcil and I am currently a Computer Science major at Concordia. My passion for web development and programming comes from the problem-solving and logical aspects of the field, as well as my interest in technology. I am constantly looking for opportunities to get familiar with and learn new technologies. I believe most efficient and enriching way to learn and create is to work as a team. During my time at university, I have been able to maintain a 4.0 GPA. I had also been granted two awards before entering university. My courses have allowed me to gain experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, as well as Java.
